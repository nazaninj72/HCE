					<p class="description"> 

					Three change operations in this study are named as "Add", "delete" and "move". 
					</p>
					<p class="description">In examples below you will see a sample for each of these operations in different visualizations.
					</p><!-- It is important to note that in real experiment changes are not shown in colors. The provided colors in this page are for demonstration purposes.-->
					
					<h3>Add:</h3>	
					<p class="description"> 

					A node can be added to the hierarchy: <br>
					In this example node "W" was <b> added</b> to the "Tree".
					</p>

					<h3>Delete:</h3>	
					<p class="description"> 

					A node or a branch can be deleted from the hierarchy: <br>
					In this example node "C"  and its children was <b> deleted</b> from "Treemap". 
					
					</p>
					<div class="photopart">

					</div>
					<h3>Move:</h3>	
					<p class="description"> 

					A node or a branch can be moved from one parent node to another in the hierarchy: <br>
					In the example below node "E" was <b> moved</b> in the "Sunburst diagram". 
					</p>
					<p class="description">As can be seen, node "E" (shown in blue) changed its parent from node "B" in left visualization to node "root A" in right visualization.<br>
