	<p>Welcome to the tutorial of hierarchical data!</p>
	<div class="upperdescription">
		<h2> Hierarchical data:</h2>
		<p class="description"> 
		The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of existing comparison tools
		on visualizing changes in hierarchical data. Thus first we provide an overview of hierarchical data and visualization types for these data and then we explain three types of changes that we use to modify the hierarchical data named as "move", " add" and "delete" operation. And at last we will provide an explanation on comaprison types that have been used in this study. </p>	
		<p class="description"> 
		Hirarchical data is defined as a set of entities that are related to each other by ranking principle. A hierarchy has a root entity that all other entities are descendents of this root. A root has at least one child entity and other child entities can have at least one or zero child.
		</p>
		<p class="description">An entity which comes below another is a child node to the entity above. Similarly, an entity which comes above another is a parent node to the node below. For example: in an employee hierarchy a CEO can be referred to as the root of all the employees which have at least one child entity as a manager (e.g., project manager,..) </p>
		<p class="description"> Hierarchical data can be shown using <em> trees, treemaps and sunburst diagrams</em>.	
		</p>
		<h3>Tree:</h3>	
		<div class="photopart">

		</div>
		<p class="description"> Above you see a visualization of tree. The root of the tree is named as "root A" and it has two children named "B" and "C" recpectively where each of these child nodes also have children. ("D", "E" and "F" are children of "B" and "G", "H" are chidlren of "C")</em>.	
		</p>
		<h3>Treemap:</h3>
		<p class="description">
		Treemap visualizes entities in the form of nested rectangles. Each branch (parent node and its children) is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches (children). The area of the rectangles are defined as the data that represent each entity. In our design, hierarchical data is only represented with  nodes and their relationship with parents or children. Hence, the area of the rectangles are calculated based on the number of children of each branch. See below example:

			 <img src="treemap.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="450" height="350">
		</div>
		<h3>Sunburst Diagram:</h3>
		<p class="description">
		Sunburst diagram is another way of visualizing hierarchical data using concentric circles. Circle in the center of the chart represent root of the hierarchy and outer circles are divided among children of the inner circle. See example below: 
		</p>
		<div class="photopart">
			
			 <img src="sunburst.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="450" height="420">
		</div>
		<p class="description">
		In the example above, "root A" is the center of the diagram and its two children "B" and  "C" are drawn in outer circles and this patter is repeated for the next nodes until reaching the last level where no node has any children.
